# Grocery-Tracking-Program

The Corner Grocer program is a text-based C++ application designed to track and analyze the 
frequency of items purchased in a grocery store. It uses a menu-driven interface to allow users to 
interact with the program easily. The program begins by reading data from a provided input file, 
CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt, which contains a list of items purchased throughout the 
day. It processes this data to count how often each item appears, storing the results in a std::map 
for quick and efficient lookup.
The program provides several menu options. Users can look up the frequency of a specific item, 
view a list of all items and their frequencies, or see a histogram that visually represents the data 
using asterisks. A key feature is the creation of a backup file, frequency.dat, which saves the 
frequency data for future use. This file is automatically generated when the program runs. The 
code incorporates basic input validation to ensure the program handles user errors gracefully, and 
it is structured with clear comments and descriptive variable names for readability.
This project demonstrates essential programming concepts like file handling, data storage using 
maps, and user interaction through a menu. The application is practical for analyzing data and 
shows how programming can solve real-world problems. Itâ€™s also a great learning experience in 
building functional, user-friendly programs with robust data processing
